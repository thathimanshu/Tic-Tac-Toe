# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Deployment

The game is deployed and playable at [Tic Tac Toe Game](https://thetictactoe.vercel.app/).

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Special Features

- Only three X's and three O's are allowed on the board at any given time. When a new symbol is placed, it removes the oldest symbol of the same type.


## Usage

1. Click on the grid cells to place your symbol (X or O).
2. The game alternates turns between players.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
5. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
